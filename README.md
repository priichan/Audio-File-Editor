# Audio-File-Editor
Used MATLAB to create an audio file editor program. The program allows a user to upload any audio file (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, etc.) and edit the file using different effects (speed and volume control, fast forward, rewind, reverse the audio file, echo, remove voice, treble, base, stereo, mono).

Refer to "ProjectReport.pdf" for instructions on using the editor.
